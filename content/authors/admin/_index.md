I am a final-year PhD researcher in Natural Language Processing at the University of Edinburgh and University of Cambridge (ELLIS program), advised by Shay Cohen, Anna Korhonen, and Edoardo Ponti. My work focuses on post-training and alignment of foundation models, with a particular emphasis on hallucination detection and mitigation, long-context reasoning, and world-model grounding across text, vision, and speech.

I have first-author publications in top venues including ICLR, NeurIPS, ACL, EMNLP, and NAACL, and my research has delivered measurable gains on real tasks such as long-context retrieval and multilingual generation. I build scalable training and inference pipelines for large models (7B+ parameters) and design alignment methods spanning SFT, RL, and decoding-time verification.

My industrial research experience includes Meta FAIR, Apple AIML (Apple AIML PhD Fellowship), Nvidia Research, and Baidu NLP. I was selected for the ELLIS PhD program (highly competitive) and have led projects that advanced omnimodal concept modeling, in-context retrieval and reasoning, and faithful generation.
